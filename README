This example autotools project makes an api library from several
convenience libraries, and includes an app that tests the api library.

prepare.sh grinds the human-prepared configs through the various
autotools to produce a project that can be built 
with "configure;make;make install".

configure.additional shows how to add functionality beyond
default to configure, including setting a conditional.

Makefile.am shows using the conditional to affect construction
of the SUBDIRS variable.

src/Makefile.am causes some header files to be installed at 
"make install" time.

src/app/Makefile.am builds the tester app using the conditional.

The convenience library Makefile.ams build the convenience libraries
as not-to-be-installed libaries.

./src/libapi/Makefile.am builds the to-be-installed api library 
from the convenience libraries, and uses the conditional.
